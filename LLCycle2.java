/**
 * Given a linked list, return the node where the cycle begins. If there is no
 * cycle, return null.
 * 
 * To represent a cycle in the given linked list, we use an integer pos which
 * represents the position (0-indexed) in the linked list where tail connects
 * to. If pos is -1, then there is no cycle in the linked list.
 * 
 * Note: Do not modify the linked list.
 * 
 * Idea is to use floyd's cycle detection algorithm, that uses 2 pointers, slow and fast.
 * Once we have detected that cycle exists, we rest one of them at head, and then both increment at speed of 1.
 * When they coincide again, thats the intersecting node.
 * 
 * Space Complexity: O(1)
 * Time Complexity: O(n)
 * 
 * Leetcode Results:
 * Runtime: 0 ms, faster than 100.00% of Java online submissions for Linked List Cycle II.
 * Memory Usage: 34.8 MB, less than 62.11% of Java online submissions for Linked List Cycle II.
