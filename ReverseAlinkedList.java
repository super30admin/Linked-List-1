// Time Complexity : O(n), traverse from head till next element from tail, null
// Space Complexity : O(1), need two pointers, prev and cur 
// Did this code successfully run on Leetcode : yes
// Any problem you faced while coding this : no, this was fine, drew on paper

// Your code here along with comments explaining your approach
// make a new tail, a null node, call it prev
// add a new pointer copying head
// now move head to head.next, point cur.next to our new tail prev, move prev to cur
// iterate till head.next is not null
