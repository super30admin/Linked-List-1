"""Approach 1:
2 passes - use 1st pass to count len of linked list and validate that n is not greater than len.
Then in 2nd pass move pointer till n-1th location and do n-1.next = n-1.next.next
that way node is considered deleted.
But handle edge case where pos is 0 that means we need to remove the first element,
just move head = head.next in that case.
Return head.

TC O(n) - we traverse list twice but still linear time
SC O(1) no extra space used

"""Approach 2:
Only one pass.
First add a dummy node before the head. Then pointer p1 initialized at dummy node.
Progress p1 until it is n+1 steps from the dummy node. Now initialize p2 at dummy node
and progress p1 and p2 until p1 doesn't reach end of the list.
Then p2 will be exactly 1 step behind the node it needs to remove.

Perform the removal, p2.next = p2.next.next but if p2.next is head of the list, then change the
head of the list to p2.next.next before you remove the node.
