// Time Complexity :O(n) for traversing till the end of the list
// Space Complexity :O(1)
// Did this code successfully run on Leetcode : Iterative - YES/ Recursive-NO
// Any problem you faced while coding this : Not able to assign
pointer1.next values in recursive

//Explanation:
#iterative
Use 3 pointers - pointer1,pointer2 and pointer3
pointer1 is initially None
Perform reverse and shift pointer1,pointer2 and pointer3 .
When pointer2 is None, return pointer1(Reversed LL)
