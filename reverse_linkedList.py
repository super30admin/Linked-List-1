""" Explanation: To execute this, we would simple need two pointers, one that can store the prev node
    of the Linked List, and one that can store the current node of the Linked List. At the beginning,
    the current node is the head node and prev node is set to null since there is no node before the
    head node. Then we simply iterate through the LinkedList and initiate another point to take care
    of the next node. Lasltly, we used the three pointers to swap the values.
