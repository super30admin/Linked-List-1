//Problem - 43

// Time Complexity : O(N)

// Space Complexity : O(1)

// Did this code successfully run on Leetcode :
//Yes

// Your code here along with comments explaining your approachÂ 
// We will use an algorithm here, which inherits the slow and fast pointer technique
// A fast pointer which is the hare here will loop around a cycle and meet the
// slow which is coined as a tortoise
// if they both meet then it signifies that a cycle/loop/intersection has been made and hence we will return that intersecting node
