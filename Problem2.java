Add an extra node with value -1 to cover the edge case when you need to remove the last node. 
 * Use two pointers. Maintain a gap of count between the two nodes. 
 * The point before the slow pointer has to be removed. 
 * Change slow.next to slow.next.next and change the slow.next to null. 
 * Return dummy.next value as head to ignore the -1.
