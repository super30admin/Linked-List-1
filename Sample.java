Problem1: Reverse a LinkedList

Approach 1: 
Iterative: have 3 pointers as prev, current & next and change their references until we hit the null
Time Complexity : O(n)
Space Complexity : O(1)
Did this code successfully run on Leetcode : Yes
  
Approach 2  
Recursive: 

Time Complexity : O(n)
Space Complexity : O(n)
Did this code successfully run on Leetcode : Yes



Problem 2: LinkedList Cycle II

Approach 1: Using HashSet
Time Complexity : O(n)
Space Complexity : O(n)
Did this code successfully run on Leetcode : Yes

Approach 2: Using two pointers, once we detect the list, reset either one of the pointers and 
if they meet its the start of the linked list.
Time Complexity : O(n)
Space Complexity : O(1)
Did this code successfully run on Leetcode : Yes
