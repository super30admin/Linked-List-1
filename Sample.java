Problem1: Reverse a LinkedList

Approach 1: 
Iterative: have 3 pointers as prev, current & next and change their references until we hit the null
Time Complexity : O(n)
Space Complexity : O(1)
Did this code successfully run on Leetcode : Yes
  
Approach 2  
Recursive: Iterate the list till last but one node and reverse the pointers

Time Complexity : O(n)
Space Complexity : O(n)
Did this code successfully run on Leetcode : Yes



Problem 2: LinkedList Cycle II

Approach 1: Using HashSet
Time Complexity : O(n)
Space Complexity : O(n)
Did this code successfully run on Leetcode : Yes

Approach 2: Using two pointers, once we detect the list, reset either one of the pointers and 
if they meet its the start of the linked list.
Time Complexity : O(n)
Space Complexity : O(1)
Did this code successfully run on Leetcode : Yes  



Problem 3: Remove Nth Node From End of List

Time Complexity :O(n)
Space Complexity :O(1)
Did this code successfully run on Leetcode :Yes

create a dummy node at start of linked list
start two pointers from this node and keep the difference of n
change the slow.next pointers to remove the node
