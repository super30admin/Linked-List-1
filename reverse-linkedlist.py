# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.next = None

#Accepted on leetcode
#Time complexity: O(n) as we are traversing through the entire linked list
#Space complexity: O(1) as we are changing the links and not creating new linked list nor using other data structure
#Explanation: This is iterative apporach where I am traversing through each node of the list, store its next value in next and change
#its current next to previous. Make previous to be current and current to be next.
