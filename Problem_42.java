//Problem - 42

// Time Complexity : O(N)

// Space Complexity : O(1)

// Did this code successfully run on Leetcode :
//Yes

// Your code here along with comments explaining your approachÂ 
//we will use a dummy node tp process on, alongwith slow and fast pointers
//once we process the fast pointer till the nth node, then we can loop out this takes 0(n)
//then we start with slow and fast simultaneously, which takes O(n) again
//the moment fast becomes null we terminate and use the delete node in a linked list logic for the slow pointer

    public ListNode removeNthFromEnd(ListNode head, int n) {
