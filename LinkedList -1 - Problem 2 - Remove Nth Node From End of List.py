19. Remove Nth Node From End of List

Time Complexity : O(N)

Space Complexity :  O(1)


Did this code successfully run on Leetcode : Yes
  

We will  use 2 pointers
Slow : to go to the requied node
Fast : to find the end of linked list

First maintain a count and move the fast pointer to matin the distance of the nth noed

then keep moving the slow and the fast node

when the fast node reached the end of the list, the slow pointer pointing the node the is the one to be removed
