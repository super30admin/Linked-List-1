S30 FAANMG Problem #52 {Medium}

142. Linked List Cycle II

Time Complexity : O(N)



Space Complexity :  O(1)


Did this code successfully run on Leetcode : Yes
  

We will  use 2 pointers
Slow : One step
Fast : two Step

If both intersect then cycle exist

To find the node where the cycle begins:
  We will reset the slow pointer 
  Move fast and slow one step at a time.
  the node at which they intersect is the start of the cyclic node
