/*

1. Create a new Linked List ptr to store the reverse Linked list
2. For every iteration, the reverse LL ptr gets updated to the first value in head & head gets updated head->next
3. After some iteration when head gets updated to head->next & head->next doesnt exist, we return reverse pointer since all the values from head have been stored in reverse now
